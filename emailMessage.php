				<form><textarea id="mail">Hey, I have decided to make you my health care proxy.I trust you to make health care decisions as I would for myself if I lose the ability to make them. I choose you because you are reliable and will uphold my wishes when I am unable to. To continue this partnership, I would like to have a meaningful conversation with you! I started a dialogue about my end-of-life intentions through a good death. 
Will you be my proxy?</textarea></form>
